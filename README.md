# Inflation of Egg Prices Across Canadian Grocery Stores

## Abstract
After the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation has been a large economic issue for the majority of Canadians. This analysis studies the inflation of egg prices in 2024 and finds that prices towards the end of the year have decreased in comparison to mid 2024. By understanding how the prices of staple grocery items fluctuate, we can gauge the effect of inflation on the general Canadian consumer.
